# DungeonGame In C++
Dungeon Fate is the choice-based game I made for my C++ class final project. This was made on October 27, 2021.

Please compile the code to run.

How to play Dungeon Fate:
Enter your name first. Then you can choose whether to read the instructions.
You can choose 7 paths by entering the number of the path you want to go.
You have to make choices to either fight or evade the enemies and decide whether to jump over or walk on the traps.
The game ends when the player either rescues the princess or runs out of lives.

Good Luck!
